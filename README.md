### Background
Magnetic reconnections are common occurrences within space and typically are harmless to us or the Earth, but strong enough ones can become disastrous. This can lead to disruptions in our tech like GPS, potentially leading to millions of dollars wasted if we do not properly prepare ahead of time. Thus, it is important to predict when this would occur to adjust and prepare for a storm.

This is where our project comes in. Our project analyzed NASA's data of the vectors of the IMF and Earth's Magnetic Field in order to find how likely magnetic reconnection occurs. We first downloaded publicly available data and complied it into text files, which were then analyzed by our code line by line, looking for breaks within the pattern and identifying outliers which may be potential storms. After analyzing, it then displays the results in an easy to understand graph that both NASA scientists and engineers can read and comprehend as well as regular people, educating the public in this phenomenon as well.

### Testing
To run it, you need to install numpy and make sure you add it to your PATH. 
Then, cd into the directory and run the code using the python command.
